# e-commerce platform using react

In this continuous project of mine, I ensured to use all the javascript skills I've learnt so far alongside with the profound assistance of react library to achieve this.

# About Project

# The languages or tools used to achieve this includes:

html - for the front end content;
javascript - for the functionality of the product;
css - for the styling and design;

**Note: there will always be new tools used / existing ones removed as the product is being modified to make it even better!!!**
